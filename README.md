# üéß Spotify Data Analysis Project

This project explores and visualizes key trends and correlations within a dataset of popular songs from Spotify. Using data analysis tools and cloud infrastructure, the project highlights important insights such as the distribution of records by artists, the relationship between song attributes (e.g., danceability, energy), and their overall popularity.

## üìä Project Overview

The project aims to answer questions about the relationship between the characteristics of popular songs and their performance using data from Spotify's API. By utilizing Amazon AWS S3 for data storage and AWS QuickSight for visualization, I created interactive dashboards to present findings and gain actionable insights into the music industry.

### Key Visualizations:
- **Count of Records by Artists**: Displayed the number of songs produced by top artists such as Taylor Swift, KAROL G, and Bad Bunny.
- **Time Signature Distribution**: Analyzed the most common time signatures in popular songs.
- **Energy vs. Valence Correlation**: Explored the relationship between energy and valence (positivity) in songs, highlighting trends in song mood.
- **Danceability vs. Popularity**: Investigated how a song‚Äôs danceability impacts its popularity and what makes a song likely to become a hit.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data preprocessing and analysis.
- **Amazon AWS S3**: Used for storing and managing the Spotify dataset.
- **AWS QuickSight**: For creating interactive and detailed visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For scripting and data analysis workflows.
- **Spotify API**: For acquiring song data.

## üí° Insights
- **Artist Popularity**: Artists like Taylor Swift and Bad Bunny consistently have higher song counts, potentially due to their influence and album releases.
- **Mood and Energy**: Songs with higher energy tend to have lower valence scores, indicating that high-energy songs may convey more intense emotions.
- **Danceability and Popularity**: Highly danceable songs are more likely to be popular, as danceability seems to be a strong factor in creating chart-topping hits.
